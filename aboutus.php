        <p>
        I'm currently a second-year Computer Science major at Colorado State University.
        Alongside my academic pursuits, I'm involved in the CSU Marching Band. As a dedicated member of the drumline, 
        I've honed my skills as a tenor drummer and proudly served as a section leader for two years, fostering teamwork and musical excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
        Looking ahead, I'm eagerly seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world settings. With a keen interest in technology's diverse applications, 
        I'm actively pursuing internships for the upcoming summer. I'm considering paths in military contracting, 
        drawn to the challenges and innovation it entails, as well as the possibility of delving into the exciting realm of amusement park ride creation and programming. 
        Ultimately, I desire to make meaningful contributions in whichever field I choose.

        I'm a senior studying Computer Information Systems. Throughout my academic journey, I've delved deep into the world of technology, fascinated by its endless possibilities. 
        From coding to system analysis, every aspect of this field ignites my curiosity and drives me to learn more. 
        Beyond the classroom, you'll often find me at church, where I cherish the sense of community and shared values.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm passionate about computers, gaming, and Lord of the Rings. These interests have been a constant source of joy and inspiration for me, shaping my worldview and 
        fueling my desire to explore the digital frontier. While I'm currently interning, my goal is to become a cybersecurity engineer. 
        I'm fascinated by the challenges and opportunities in cybersecurity and look forward to making a difference in the digital world, safeguarding systems and protecting data 
        from potential threats.
